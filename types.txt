When creating a variable, there are two main ways TypeScript assigns a type:
Explicit
Implicit
Explicit - writing out the type:
let firstName: string = "Dylan";
let age:number=23;
let isStudent:boolean=true;
Implicit - TypeScript will "guess" the type, based on the assigned value:
let firstName = "Dylan";
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
let person: { name: string; age: number } = {
    name: "Tanya",
    age: 22,
};
