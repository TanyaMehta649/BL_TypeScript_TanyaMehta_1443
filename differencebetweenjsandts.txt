JS- A lightweight, interpreted, or JIT-compiled programming language primarily used for building dynamic web applications.
Errors are typically detected at runtime, leading to potential bugs during execution.
Supports ECMAScript (ES) standards and features like let, const, arrow functions, classes, etc.
No compilation step; it runs directly in browsers or Node.js environments.
By default, JS allows dynamic and flexible behavior that can lead to unintended results.
let x = "5" - 1; // Result: 4 (type coercion)
doesnot supports OOPS advanced features like abstract classes or Interfaces
Slightly faster to execute since it doesnâ€™t involve a compilation step.
TS-A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to improve code reliability and maintainability.
Errors are caught at compile time, reducing the likelihood of runtime bugs.
Includes all JavaScript features plus additional ones: Interfaces,Enums,Generics, Tuples
Needs to be compiled to JavaScript before execution using the TypeScript compiler (tsc).
TypeScript enforces stricter rules, catching issues before runtime.
let x: string = "5" - 1; // Compile-time error
Extends JavaScript's OOP capabilities with features like interfaces, access modifiers (private, protected), and abstract classes.
Slower during development due to the compilation step
