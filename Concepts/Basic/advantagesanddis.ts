// ADVANTAGES
// in js we can write it as 
// let name="tanya"
// name=78
// name=true 
// console.log(name) true will be printed 
// but in case of TypeScript
let fname:string="vinod"
// fname=106
// it will produce error
// TypeScript allows developers to define data types, which helps catch errors during development rather than at runtime.
// Works seamlessly with popular tools and frameworks, such as React, Angular, and Vue.
// Includes features like interfaces, generics, and access modifiers, enabling robust design patterns and better code structuring.
// DISADVANTAGES
// TypeScript must be compiled into JavaScript, which adds an extra step to the development process.
// The additional complexity of types and compilation might slow down development initially.
// The primary compiler used for TypeScript is the TypeScript Compiler (TSC). It is provided as part of the TypeScript package and is responsible for converting TypeScript code into plain JavaScript, which can be executed in browsers or Node.js environments.
